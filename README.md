# Git DHS Recode VII
### General Codes: 
Currently, we have general codes for 
Do-file1: c_anc_skill ///
Do-file2: c_facdel c_hospdel c_sba ///
Do-file8: c_diarrhea_pro c_treatARI

We use R/STATA to scrape labels from RAW Data and produce a classification excel file. And consult with Sven about the classification. Theoretically, the general codes should cover all country cases. However, some countries may have missing labels that general codes may fail to capture. So, we should always DOUBLE CHECK each country to see if the general code do work in a correct way! 
And also need to update general codes when new surveys come out.

### New Surveys come out:
Use Git-DHS-Recode-VII/Quality/DHS_API_2_2.0.R to update DHS.dta for comparative analysis

Thanks!
